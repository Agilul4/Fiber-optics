# Fiber-Laser-model
Python script to simulate performance of an Ytterbium doped fiber laser/amplifier.

The model assumes a two-level system with the system operating in the steady state (dN2/dt = 0). 
By assuming steady state operation, it is possible to get an exact value for the inversion at every step along the active fiber.
This value is then used to determine the power(s) of the signal and pump respectively.
